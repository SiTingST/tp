## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `AppointmentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Student

#### Actual Implementation

The `Add` Student mechanism is implemented in the `AddCommand` class and facilitated by the following classes:
* `Command`. `AddCommand` extends `Command` and overrides the `execute` method, which adds a `Person` to the `Model`. 
* `AddCommandParser`. It implements the `Parser` interface, which is used by all commands to read user input. `AddCommandParser` also checks the parameters of `AddCommand` and make sures that the input adheres to the specified format. 

All 8 compulsory fields and 1 optional field in `Person` are updated and added to the system following the user input. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Add` Student mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user executes `add n/John Doe i/A1234567X f/COM p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 s/vaccinated m/peanut allergy r/RVRC` to add a student. The `AddressBookParser` class determines that the command called is `Add`, and therefore creates a new `AddCommandParser` instance to parse the command.

![Receiving an input](images/ReceiveInput.png)


Step 2: The `AddCommandParser` instance obtains the user input and checks for its validity. It then returns a new `AddCommand` instance to the `LogicManager` via the `AddressBookParser` class.

> **NOTE:** If the input format is incorrect or not found, `AddCommandParser` will throw a `ParseException` to tell the user about the error, and execution will stop. 

![Parsing an input](images/ParseInput.png)


Step 3: With the `AddCommand` instance, the overridden `execute` method is called to add the `Model` to the `Person`. The `LogicManager` then receives the result of the execution of the command. 

![Processing an input](images/ProcessResult.png)


Step 4: The added `Person` is saved into the `StudentBook`. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `Add` operation works:

![Add Sequence Diagram](images/SequenceDiagram.png)


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `Add` command:

![Add Activity Diagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How `Add` Student executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add all the attributes of a student at once
    * Pros: 
      * All the student attributes will be completed in one command, less likely to introduce bugs. 
    * Cons: 
      * Command can be difficult to use, confusing to check. 
      * User needs to know all the attributes of a student before adding to system.  

* **Alternative 2:** Add each student attribute individually
  * Pros: 
    * Easier for user to input, potentially fewer mistakes as user can check each attribute individually.
    * User does not need to know all the information of a student before adding to system. 
  * Cons: 
    * User could forget to add certain attributes, potentially causing bugs later. 
    
In the end, Alternative 1 was chosen because it is less likely to introduce bugs into the system, even though it comes with some usability cost. However, the cost of having multiple bugs could be greater. Moreover, the user can use the edit command afterwards to fix any incorrect information added. This would help to mitigate some downsides of this implementation.

*{More to be added}*

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Vaccine**: Singapore has two approved COVID-19 vaccines, one developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, 
  the other by Moderna. Both require two doses, 21 days apart for Pfizer-BioNTech, 28 days apart for Moderna.
  Two appointments must therefore be created per student.
