Vax@NUS is a **one stop management app to efficiently track and schedule COVID-19 vaccinations for NUS students.** It is a desktop app **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Vax@NUS can get your appointment management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: NOTE ABOUT THE COMMAND FORMAT :**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [r/SCHOOL RESIDENCE]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/RC4` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  
* For commands with prefixs, 
  
   * Parameters can be in any order.<br>
   e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
  
   * If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
   e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
